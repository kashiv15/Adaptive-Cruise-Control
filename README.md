# Adaptive-Cruise-Control
Proof and Verification
This is a final project for my course in Cyber-Physical Systems at Virginia Tech.

The project focuses on autonomous driving. In this we gave importance to minimize the gap between realtime and thoeritical implementation. We have used KeYmaera X -A theorem prover for
Hybrid Systems.

You can download KeYmaera X at http://www.ls.cs.cmu.edu/KeYmaeraX/

There are two control logic implemented
One is used for obstacle avoidance of 1D object and a Lead car. -1D Obstacle Avoidance.kyx
Another is used for controlling the ego car based on the trajectory of lead car.-Cruise Control.kyx

There is a report for review of the project.

I thank Dhanush Sureshbabu for contributng to this project.
